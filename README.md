# maths
The end goal is to allow users to solve mathematical problems and teach them how to solve them themselves.

Current features:
  - Averages
  - Binary conversion
  - Clock conversion (12 hour to 24 hour)
  - Triangle calculator (not working)

All of the above are for solving problems; no teaching has been implemented yet.

Users can also favourite the tools they use most often.
